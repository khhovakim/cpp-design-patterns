# 📝 LoggerProject - Singleton Pattern in C++

This project demonstrates the use of the **Singleton Design Pattern** through a simple yet practical **Logger system**. The logger ensures that only one instance handles all logging operations, maintaining a centralized and consistent logging mechanism across an application.

---

## 🧠 Design Pattern Used

### 🧩 Singleton Pattern

- Guarantees that only **one instance** of the `Logger` class exists.
- Provides a **global access point** to this instance.
- Handles internal synchronization with `std::mutex` for thread safety.

---

## 🧪 Project Overview

The `Logger`:
- Writes logs to a file (`logs.txt`)
- Supports log levels: `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`
- Formats messages with timestamps and log level indicators
- Is accessible globally via `Logger::getInstance()`

## 🗂️ File Structure

- `LoggerProject/`
  - `include/logger.h`  – Logger class declaration
  - `include/color.h`   – Coloring for output
  - `src/logger.cpp`    – Logger class definition
  - `obj/*`             – Object files (auto-created)
  - `log/logs.txt`      – Output log file (auto-created)
  - `main.cpp`          – Example usage of the Logger
  - `Makefile`          – Automating program Compilation
