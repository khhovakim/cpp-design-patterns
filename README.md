# 🎯 C++ Design Patterns

Welcome to **cpp-design-patterns** — a curated collection of classic **design pattern implementations** in modern **C++20**, each built cleanly, modularly, and explained with real-world examples.

Each project:
- ✅ Demonstrates a specific design pattern
- 🧱 Uses modern C++ best practices
- 📝 Includes a project-specific `README.md`
- ⚙️ Comes with a simple Makefile to build and run
