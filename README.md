## ðŸ§© Pattern Categories

### ðŸš§ Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms.

- ðŸ”¹ [Singleton](./Creational/Singleton/README.md) â€” A creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to it. This is useful for managing shared resources or implementing centralized control mechanisms.
- ðŸ”¹ [Factory Method](./Creational/FactoryMethod/README.md) â€” A creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
